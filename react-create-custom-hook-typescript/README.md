# How to build React Custom Hooks in Typescript.

This is the example code for building custom hooks in react with typescript.

The base code was created with `create-react-app`, but of course the concepts can be applied to any project running react and typescript.

_if you cloned this example_ don't forget to install dependancies, with `npm i` or `yarn`.

# Steps to reproduce this example

Bootstrap a project running react.

`npx create-react-app react-custom-hook-typescript --template typescript`

This is not the only way to get up and running with react, if you wish you can bootstrap a project using vite, next.js etc.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
